In this workshop I learned about class inheritance, where a derived class can be created from a base classe.

In this process, the derived (child) class inherits the base (parent) class' member variables and functions, reducing redundancy in coding classes that are related to each other and making development faster.

The base / parent class does not need to know about the derived / child class and it can be instanced as an independent entity.

The derived class, on the other hand, needs to know about the base class as it is an "extended" entity of the base class.

When a SuperHero and a Hero battle out, the message printed was "Ancient Battle!" because the function used in the battle was the one from the base class Hero.
