1) What type have you selected for ISBN? Explain your reasoning.

I selected the 'long long' type for ISBN.

The reason for selecting long long is that it can hold an integer number of value up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

The only other type that could hold such a large number is __int64, but t is a non-standard data type.


2) For the at-home portion you had to change the logic that validates an ISBN. How would you design your class in such a way that if a new update to the validation logic is necessary, you don’t have to change anything in the function Book::set(...) ?

I would add a function member ( Book::isISBNValid() ) to the Book class (probably as a private member) that would execute the validation logic and return a boolean value indicating if the ISBN number is valid or not.

I would then change the Book::set() function to call the isISBNValid() when needed.

Whenever the validation logic changed, I would only update the isISBNValid() function and keep the set() function as it is.
